# Notes

given the definition of a differential equation how do we separate things further in a way that's useful.

well we can group differential equations by whether there is a single change variable (whats the technical term?) or
multiple variables of change.

you can quite easily see which group a differential equation falls under through the actual mathematical equation that
describes a particular differential equation.

if every derivative in the equation is taken with respect to the same variable then it is an ordinary differential
equation, otherwise if there are more than one type of variable of which you differentiate with respect to then you have
a partial differential equation.

It turns out that studying these categories of differential equations separately makes sense.
