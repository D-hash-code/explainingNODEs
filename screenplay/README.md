Scenes:
1. Hello 
2. What are Differential Equations? 
3. How are these related to Neural Networks?


### Scene 1: Hello
Differential Equations have an old history. Neural networks, in their modern form, are comparatively recent. How are these fields are related? Before answering this question we need to introduce differential equations.


### Scene 2: What are differential equations
The introduction to differential equations assumes familiarity with things like polynomial equations, functions and dimensionality of problems.

Discussion Points;
- the architecture of differential equations
  - the change variable
  - the parameters
  - comparisons to a 'typical' function -- what IS a solution to a DE?
  - the implicit nature of DEs
- categories of DEs
  - Higher order
  - PDE, ODE and SDE
- Solving ODEs
  - the problem statement
  - solving the ode
  - a picture for solvers

### Scene 3: How are Differential Equations Related to Neural Networks?
