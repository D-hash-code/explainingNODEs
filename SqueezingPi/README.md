## Notes

"When I walk to my office or go out with my dog for an evening stroll, the pedometer on my iPhone keeps track of how far I walk. The calculation is simple: The app estimates the length of my stride based on my height and counts how many steps I’ve taken, then it multiplies those two numbers together. The distance traveled equals stride length times the number of steps taken. Archimedes used a similar idea to calculate the circumference of a circle and to estimate pi. Think of the circle as a track. It takes a lot of steps to walk all the way around. The path would look something like this.

Each step is represented by a tiny straight line. By multiplying the number of steps by the length of each one, we can estimate the length of the track. It’s only an estimate, of course, because the circle is not actually made up of straight lines. It’s made up of curved arcs. When we replace each arc by a straight line, we’re taking a slight shortcut. And so the approximation is sure to underestimate the true length of the circular track. But, at least in theory, by taking enough steps and making them

small enough, we can approximate the length of the track as accurately as we wish. Archimedes did a series of calculations like this, starting with a path made up of six straight steps.

He began with a hexagon because it was a convenient base camp from which to embark on the more arduous calculations 
ahead. The advantage of the hexagon was that he could easily calculate its perimeter, the total length around the hexagon. It’s six times the radius of the circle. Why six? Because the hexagon contains six equilateral triangles, each side of which equals the circle’s radius. 

Six of the triangle’s sides make up the perimeter of the hexagon. 

So the perimeter equals six times the radius; in symbols, p = 6r. Then, since the circle’s circumference C is longer than the hexagon’s perimeter p, we must have C > 6r.

This argument gave Archimedes a lower bound on what we would call pi, written as the Greek letter π and defined as the ratio of the circumference to the diameter of the circle. Since the diameter d equals 2r, the inequality C > 6r implies π = C / d = C / 2r > 6r / 2r = 3. Thus the hexagon argument demonstrates π > 3. Of course, six is a ridiculously small number of steps, and the resulting hexagon is obviously a very crude caricature of a circle, but Archimedes was just getting started. Once he figured out what the hexagon was telling him, he shortened the steps and took twice as many of them. He did that by detouring to the midpoint of each arc, taking two baby steps instead of striding across the arc in one big step.
