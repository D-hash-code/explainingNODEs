# math in x seconds

Each topic has its own folder.

Within each folder there will be;
- .py files for video generation
- a screenplay.md file for the screenplay: scenes and script
- a notes.md file for notes

Just to note, I'm unapologetically naive about these subjects. I don't claim to be an expert on any of the topics. I find maths interesting and wished visual explanations of maths topics were available to me earlier.

Maths is interpreted as being _about_ numbers. I think maths is about patterns. Numbers are a handy way to talk about patterns.

One thing that fascinates me about maths is that when you talk about it you don't have to preface every sentence with "most of the time", like you do in _the real world_
