# explainingNODEs

What are these Neural ODEs that people speak off?? But first Manim.


# Structure

The 5-part segmentation that's currently in my head.

1. Basics of Neural Networks
2. Basics of Differential Equations
3. Neural Differential Equations with a simple example that serves as groundwork
4. Diving into details, through a complex example
5. State of play

## 1. Basics of Neural Networks
I can tackle this task in many ways. 

#### Refinement:

Keep the section under 2 minutes. Motivate the imagery of the neural network segmenting/transforming a plane for something like classification. How it maps points in a certain region to certain points. 

The _flow_ that this mapping creates. Show the difference of this flow when there are 2 hidden layers versus 15 versus 50.


## 2. Basics of Differential Equations

Want to go in more detail here than in the basics of neural networks. DEs are less common in computer science.

Discussion Points;
- the architecture of differential equations
  - the change variable
  - the parameters
  - comparisons to a 'typical' function -- what IS a solution to a DE?
  - the implicit nature of DEs
- categories of DEs
  - Higher order
  - PDE, ODE and SDE
- Solving ODEs
  - the problem statement
  - solving the ode
  - a picture for solvers
