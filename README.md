# explainingNODEs

What are these Neural ODEs that people speak off?? But first Manim.


# Structure

The 5-part segmentation that's currently in my head.

1. Basics of Neural Networks
2. Basics of Differential Equations
3. Neural Differential Equations with a simple example that serves as groundwork
4. Diving into details, through a complex example
5. State of play

## 1. Basics
I can tackle this task in many ways. 

#### Refinement:

Keep the section under 2 minutes. Motivate the imagery of the neural network segmenting/transforming a plane for something like classification. How it maps points in a certain region to certain points. 

The _flow_ that this mapping creates. Show the difference of this flow when there are 2 hidden layers versus 15 versus 50.
