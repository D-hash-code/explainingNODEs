# math in x seconds

Each topic has its own folder.

Within each folder there will be;

- .py files for video generation
- README.md with the following sections
    - Notes for notes
    - a screenplay section for the screenplay: what scenes are there, what do those scenes look like, tags to the
      scripts
    - a script section for the script that will be tagged in the screenplay

Just to note, I'm unapologetically naive about these subjects. I don't claim to be an expert on any of the topics. I
find maths interesting and wished visual explanations of maths topics were available to me earlier.

Maths is interpreted as being _about_ numbers. I think maths is about patterns. Numbers are a handy way to talk about
patterns.

One thing that fascinates me about maths is that when you talk about it you don't have to preface every sentence with "
most of the time", like you do in _the real world_
